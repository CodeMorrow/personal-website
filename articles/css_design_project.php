<p>This task was to duplicate a given web page using only HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>Using FLEX to create the layout of the site was a challenge since I am still new to it. After the layout was create, the background colors were added. By using a color picker I was able to duplicate the exact color of the given web-page.</p>

<p>Then my web page needed its content. I developed all of the individual components one by one in a separate Gallery.php file. Using this technique ensured the component was only responsible for itself and left the layout of the page alone. Once the components were completed I picked and plugged the components in to the desired locations.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed this exercise! Please scroll down and check out the two web pages and compare.</p>
