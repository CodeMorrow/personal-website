	<p>The first three weeks of class have been very challenging. I have enjoyed every minute of it as well. The Rock, Paper, Scissors game was a lot of fun to put together, while the tic-tact-toe game was more challenging and had me stumped in some places. I really enjoyed the CSS Design project.</p>

	<p>When it comes to back-end development I tend to struggle through most the coding but once the functions and methods come together as a whole to execute the given task, I get a great sense of accomplishment. That feeling is highly motivating. The issue I have is that feeling doesn't usually come to me until I have most the project finished. Not finding that motivation until the pieces come together makes pushing through obstacles difficult. </p>

	<p>When it comes to the front-end develop the story is a bit different. I get that sense of motivation and accomplishment throughout the project. I think this is due to the actual visual evidence of my code working. I find front-end development to be a fun project rather than something that needs to be complete. I have a greater passion for the style of a site.  I had a feeling I was leaning toward front-end before this class started and these three weeks have made that feeling stronger. I am very excited to see how much more I can learn and accomplish with front-end development.</p>
