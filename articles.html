		<h3>8 Characteristics Of Successful User Interfaces</h3>
		<p>User interface design can be a difficult process. Trying to predict how a person will respond to your website or app can be almost impossible. One can try to be simplistic and make buttons and links obvious to find, while others try to be creative and bring uniqueness to their design. While both have their advantages, many issues can arise from each tactic. With the simplistic approach the user might find the website dull and unattractive. While the unique design might bring usability and functionality issues to the table. There might not be a perfectly correct user interface, these 8 characteristics are great to consider while designing a interface.</p>

		<p>8 characteristics to a good user interface are Clear, Concise, Familiar, Responsive, Consistent, Attractive, Efficient, and Forgiving.</p>

		<p>Clarity may be the most important aspect of user interface design. If the user cannot figure out how the app or website works with little to no thought it is extremely likely the user will leave the app and never return.</p>

		<p>While clarity is important if you add too much content to a page you can bury the user in useless information. You want your information to contain as few words as possible. The smaller amount of words on a page will allow the user to read the important information faster and achieve their goal quicker.</p>

		<p>You might think being unique would be a great way to get noticed but you may be achieving the exact opposite effect. There are many design that people have come to expect on an app or website. For example the scroll bar on the right hand side is very familiar to everyone. If you go and try to change the design of it too much the user might not know how to scroll down you page and complete their goal. Leaving the user frustrated and likely to avoid your site. Be creative but don't lose the main aspect of the most basic website tools.</p>

		<p>Making website responsive can be a great way to create a good user interface. When a person goes from one device to another the website should still function smoothly.  It can be wise to make smaller screen device apps simpler since not as much information can fit on the screen. It keeps the user from being overwhelmed and the app itself will be faster.</p>

		<p>Consistency is a another great characteristic. When going from on page to another page of the app, you want the same format all around. It allows users to develop usage patterns and will make it easier for user to learn new features quicker.</p>

		<p>Attractiveness can be a tricky situation when it comes to user interface. You want to maintain a simple, efficient, and responsive app but it you can make those features like nice, the user experience on your app will be more pleasant.</p>

		<p>Efficiency was mentioned in the last paragraph. Important information shouldn't be more than 2 or 3 clicks away. Users that have to search and search for the element they are looking for may just leave your app and attempt to find the information somewhere else.</p>

		<p>And lastly a forgiving app is a pleasant app. Making deleting information a task that requires multiple confirmation saves the user form accidents. The more troubleshooting you app can do on its own makes the app of higher quality.</p>

		<p>It can be troubling trying to strike balance between these 8 characteristics but as long as you try to touch on all 8 your appâ€™s user interface will be much more enjoyable. </p>
